## what does this project do?

`jekyll-tailwind` is simply a boilerplate for myself (and others) to create
jekyll sites, taking advantage of tailwind (and it's pretty typography
plugin), that seamlessly and easily work on GitHub Pages.

the best part? there is no reliance on node.js!

## are there any requirements?

a couple. see
